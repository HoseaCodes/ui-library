## Usage

Here's an example of how to use UI Heat components in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button, Card, Navbar } from 'ui-heat';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar title="My App" />
      <div className="container">
        <Card>
          <h2>Welcome to UI Heat!</h2>
          <p>Build beautiful and interactive user interfaces with ease.</p>
          <Button primary>Get Started</Button>
        </Card>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, we import and use UI Heat's Navbar, Card, and Button components to create a simple user interface. You can customize these components to match your project's design requirements.
